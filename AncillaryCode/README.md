This folder is intended to contain code packages meant to inform or guide WAB development.

For instance, widgets developed for the legacy FlexBuilder app, or pure JavaScript modules written prior to the development of the WAB.

Each discrete code packaged should be placed in a folder within the AncillaryCode folder with as much documentation as possible.
